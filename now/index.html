<h1>What I’m Doing Now</h1>

<h2>Learning to Code</h2>

<p>More text about me learning to code will eventually go here. I'm working on it!</p>

<h2>Planning to Go Racing</h2>

<p>I'll have more to say about this here soon as well.</p>

<hr />

<p> Previous versions of my now page included mentions of book reading and journal writing and sleep prioritizing that I was always hoping to do but rarely actually did.</p>

<p>The new beginning that I&#39;m experiencing has two pillars: coding and motocross.</p>

<p>I&#39;m deciding not to add a third catch-all pillar to this page for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Stating smaller activities I wish to be doing on this page won&#39;t make me do them.</li>

	<li>It’s not necessary to publicly say, &quot;Look at me! My life is so put together that I read 25 pages before bed every night!&quot; I should be reading and journaling anyway.</li>
</ul>

<p>Coding and motocross. Those are the main things right now and I&#39;m so excited about them.</p>
